# 🌟 Oasis Infobyte AICTE OIB-SIP 2024: Project Submissions

## 📝 Introduction

Welcome to my project repository for the August Phase 1 AICTE OIB-SIP 2024 internship at Oasis Infobyte. This repository contains the projects I've worked on during the internship. These projects demonstrate my skills and understanding of various machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques.

## 📊 Project Overview

### 1. 🌸 Iris Classification
- **Objective**: To classify iris species based on features like petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width.
- **Methods Used**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree.
- **Outcome**: Achieved high accuracy in predicting iris species, with visualizations to showcase class separation.

### 2. 🚗 Car Price Prediction
- **Objective**: To predict the selling price of cars based on various features such as mileage, engine size, horsepower, and more.
- **Methods Used**: Dicision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN.
- **Outcome**: Developed a model that accurately predicts car prices, with the log transformation applied to the target variable to handle skewness.

### 3. 💹 Sales Prediction
- **Objective**: To predict future sales based on historical sales data and other relevant features.
- **Methods Used**: Time Series Analysis, ARIMA, LSTM.
- **Outcome**: Generated forecasts with strong predictive performance, visualized through time series plots.


3. **Run the Code**:
   Each project folder contains a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file where the code is explained step by step. Open the notebook and run the cells sequentially to reproduce the results.

## 📅 Submission
